# Zombie War Group Project CSC 422
Group Assignment by: Rachel, Taite, Moua, and Ibrahim. 

This Project simulates a war between zombies and survivors.
Each character has their own health and attack.
The program makes the zombies and survivors fight and reports how many survivors made it to safety.

# Files Used:
The Parent class Character.java was the main class that had the variables for Zombies and Survivors
For the Zombies, we had two classes - CommonInfected.java and Tank.java
The survivor had three classes - Child.java, Teacher.java, and Soldier.java

# Program Logic
<<<<<<< HEAD
The program generates survivors and zombies. Make each survivor attack every zombie, and have a zombie attack every survivor. Repeats until all zombies are dead or all survivors are dead. Once this is done, it prints the number of survivors who made it to safety.
